| OP14-001   | Trafalgar Law    | Can I use this [Activate: Main] effect to swap the base power of my character with that of an opponent's Character, or to swap the base powers of two of my opponent's Characters?                                                                                                   | No, you cannot.                                                                                                                                                         |

In this situation, what would the power of "PRB02-002 Trafalgar Law" become? | The base power of "PRB02-002 Trafalgar Law" would become 0, and since the effect from "PRB02-002 Trafalgar Law" is giving -2000 power, the card's power would be -2000. |

Since the base power of "St. Marcus Mars" becomes 7000, can I use its [On Play] effect to K.O. this card?                                        | Yes, you can.                                                                                                                                                           |

| EB04-022 | Issho             | If my opponent has 5 or less cards in their hand, can I still use this card's [On Play] effect to trash 2 cards from my hand?                                                                                                                    | Yes, you can. In this situation, your opponent does not place 2 cards from their hand at the bottom of their deck in any order. |
| EB04-034 | Charlotte Pudding | If I activate this card's [On Your Opponent's Attack] effect while I have 3 cards in my trash, then use it to discard 1 more card so I have 4 cards in my trash, can I give up to 1 of my Leader or Character cards +2000 power for this battle? | Yes, you can.                                                                                                                   |

| EB04-040   | Flame Dragon Torch   | If none of my Kaido cards are on the field, can I still use this card's [Main] effect to rest 6 of my DON!! cards and 1 of my opponent's Characters?   | Yes, you can.   |
