1. Game Overview

1-1. Number of Players

1-1-1. This is a two-player competitive game. There are currently no official rules for games with any other number of players. 

1-2. Winning and Losing the Game 

1-2-1. The game ends when either player loses the game. If a player’s opponent loses the game, and that player did not,they win the game. 

1-2-1-1. The two loss conditions are as follows: 

1-2-1-1-1. Your life reaches zero cards and your Leader sustains damage. 

1-2-1-1-2. Your deck reaches zero cards. 

1-2-2. If either player fulfills a loss condition, that player loses the game the next time rules processing is performed. (See 9.Rule Processing.) 

1-2-2-1. During the game, if either player’s life reaches zero cards and then that player’s leader sustains damage, that player fulfills the corresponding loss condition. 

1-2-2-2. During the game, if either player’s deck reaches zero cards, that player fulfills the corresponding loss condition. 

1-2-3. If both players simultaneously fulfill loss conditions, the game is a draw. 

1-2-4. Either player may resign during the game at any time of their liking. A surrendering player instantly loses, and the game ends. 

1-2-5. The act of resigning is not affected by any cards. Players can never be forced to resign due to card effects, and loss by resignation is not subject to any replacement effects. 

1-2-6. Some card effects can make a player win or lose the game. In such cases, that player wins or loses during that processing, and the game ends. 

1-3. Fundamental Principles

1-3-1. Any text written on cards that conflicts with the Comprehensive Rules is prioritized over the rules. 

1-3-2. If a player is requested to perform an impossible action for some reason, that action is not carried out. Similarly, if an effect requests that a player carry out a certain number of actions and some of those actions are not fully possible, that player must perform as many of the requested actions as possible. 

1-3-2-1. If an existing object is requested to be changed to some state but is already in that state, the object does not again switch to that state. Instead, the action itself is not carried out. 

1-3-2-2. If a player is requested to carry out some action zero or a negative number of times for some reason, that action is not carried out. Conducting a certain action a negative number of times does not imply carrying out the opposite action. 

1-3-3. If a card effect instructs a player to carry out a certain action, but there is an active effect prohibiting that action, that effect is prioritized and the action is not carried out. 

1-3-4. If multiple players are simultaneously requested to make a choice for some reason, the turn player makes their choice first. The non-turn player chooses after that. 

1-3-5. If a player must choose a number due to card effects or rules, the number must be an integer greater than or equal to 0 unless otherwise specified. Numbers that include fractions less than 1 and negative numbers can’t be chosen. 

1-3-5-1. If cards or rules indicate a maximum number such as “up to,” the player can choose 0 unless a minimum number is specified. 

1-3-6. If a card effect rewrites information on a card, unless otherwise specified or there are rule definitions to the contrary, numbers on a card can’t include fractions less than 1. If the numbers (other than power) reach negative values,with the exception of situations where numbers are either added or subtracted, they are treated as 0. 

1-3-7. Power can become a negative value.

1-3-7-1. Even if the power is changed to a negative value,unless otherwise specified, that card can’t be moved,including trashing it. 

1-3-8. Unless otherwise specified, card effects are resolved in the order they are described on the card. 

1-3-9. If card effects instruct a player to carry out actions in a way that would switch a card to rested and active simultaneously,the effect requiring the switch to rested always takes priority.

1-3-10. Costs and activation costs

1-3-10-1. Cost refers to the cost paid when playing a card.The cost is the number at the upper left of each card.(See 6-5-3-1.) 

1-3-10-2. Activation cost refers to the cost necessary to activate a card effect. (See 8-3.)

7-1-2-3. At the end of the Block Step, if the attacking card or attack target somehow moves to a different area, play proceeds to the end of the battle (see 7-1-5) without proceeding to the Counter Step (see 7-1-3). 

7-1-3. Counter Step 

7-1-3-1. The player being attacked activates any effects that activate “after being attacked.” 

7-1-3-2. The player being attacked can perform the actions below as many times as they like in any order. 

7-1-3-2-1. Activating “(Icon) Counter”: The player being attacked can trash a Character card with “(Icon)Counter” to increase the power of their leader or 1 Character card by the “(Icon) Counter” value for the duration of the battle. 

7-1-3-2-2. Activating Event cards: The player being attacked can pay the cost of an Event card in their hand with [Counter] and trash it to activate the [Counter] effect. 

7-1-3-2-3. At the end of the Counter Step, if the attacking card or attack target somehow moves to a different area, play proceeds to the end of the battle (see 7-1-5) without proceeding to the Damage Step (see 7-1-4). 

7-1-4. Damage Step 

7-1-4-1. Compare the power of the attacking card to the power of the card being attacked. If the attacking card’s power is greater than or equal to that of the card being attacked, the attacking card wins the battle, and—depending on the type of card being attacked—the result is as described in either 7-1-4-1-1 or 7-1-4-1-2. 

7-1-4-1-1. If the card being attacked is a Leader card:Inflict 1 damage to that Leader. 

7-1-4-1-1-1. Once the infliction of damage is finalized, if the opponent has zero life cards, the attacking player wins the game. 

7-1-4-1-1-2. Once the infliction of damage is finalized, if the opponent has 1 or more life cards,the opponent takes 1 card from the top of their Life Area and adds it to their hand. If the card they add to their hand in this way has [Trigger],they may choose to reveal that card and activate its [Trigger] instead of adding the card to their hand. (See 10-1-5.) 

7-1-4-1-1-3. In cases where the sustained damage is 2 or more—such as due to effects like [Double Attack]—repeat 7-1-4-1-1-2 once for each point of damage sustained. 

7-1-4-1-2. If the card being attacked is a Character card:KO that Character card. (See 10-2-1.) Next,

7-1-4-2. If the attacking card’s power is less than that of the card being attacked, the attacking card loses the battle, and nothing happens as a result of that battle.Next, proceed to the end of the battle (see 7-1-5). 

7-1-5. End of the battle 

7-1-5-1. The battle ends. 

7-1-5-2. You and your opponent’s effects that activate “at the end of the battle” or "if this Character battles your opponent's Character" activate. 

7-1-5-3. The turn player’s effects that are active “during this battle” are rendered invalid. 

7-1-5-4. The non-turn player’s effects that are active “during this battle” are rendered invalid. 

7-1-5-5. The battle ends, and play returns to 6-5-2. 

8. Activating and Resolving Effects 

8-1. Effects 

8-1-1. Effects are orders that occur due to card text as well as their costs. 

8-1-2. Effects include effects that “do X” and effects that “may do X.”Effects that “do X” always activate and are processed as much as possible. In the case of effects that “may do X,” you can choose not to activate the effect. 

8-1-3. In general, there are three types of effects: automatic effects,activated effects, and permanent effects. 

8-1-3-1. Automatic effects are automatically activated once each time the specified event occurs during the game.If the same event occurs more than once, the corresponding automatic effect automatically occurs once each time unless otherwise specified. 

8-1-3-2. If the events specified for multiple effects occur at the same time during the game, first the turn player performs the processing for their permanent effects, then the non-turn player performs the processing for their permanent effects. Next, the turn player determines the order in which to activate and resolve their automatic effects, then the non-turn player determines the order in which to activate and resolve their automatic effects. 

8-1-3-2-1. Cards sometimes describe automatic effects as occurring [On Play], [When Attacking], [When Blocking], [On KO], [End of Your Turn], or [End of Your Opponent’s Turn]. Other effects described as occurring “when something is done”or “when something happens to something else” are also considered automatic effects. 

8-1-3-2-2. Some automatic effects require that activation costs be paid or that conditions be fulfilled. 

8-1-3-3. Activated effects can be activated by the turn player during the Main Phase (see 6-5-4) by declaring them. 

8-1-3-3-1. Cards sometimes indicate activated effects as [Activate: Main] or [Main]. 

8-1-3-3-2. Some activated effects require that activation costs be paid or that conditions be fulfilled. 

8-1-3-4. Permanent effects continuously have an effect as long as they are valid. 

8-1-3-4-1. Effects that can’t be categorized as automatic effects or activated effects are sometimes categorized as permanent effects on cards. 

8-1-3-4-2. Some permanent effects require that conditions be fulfilled in order to render the effects valid. 

8-1-3-4-3. Some permanent effects replace specific deck construction conditions during game preparation.

8-1-3-4-4. Some permanent effects are specified by the rules,and such effects are valid and have a continuous effect even if they are in secret areas. 

8-1-3-4-5. As long as they satisfy their conditions, permanent effects are always valid and continuously have an effect. 

8-2. Rendering Effects Valid or Invalid 

8-2-1. Some effects may render specific effects valid or invalid. In this case, follow the rules below. 

8-2-1-1. If an effect specifies that an effect is partially or totally invalid under specific conditions, that effect does not occur. If the invalid effect would normally require a choice, the choice is not made. In addition,the activation costs of invalid effects can’t be paid. 

8-2-1-2. If an effect is specified as partially or totally valid only under specific conditions, the specified part is invalid if those conditions are not fulfilled. 

8-2-2. If the effects of a card are rendered invalid, that card is not treated as “(a card) with no effects to begin with.”

8-3. Activation Costs and Conditions 

8-3-1. Some effects provide instructions to perform an action before a colon (“ : ”). This is called the effect’s activation cost. 

8-3-1-1. If an activation cost requires multiple actions,perform the actions in order starting from the beginning of the text. 

8-3-1-2. Next, if an activation cost has been added due to a different effect, resolve such effects in order. 

8-3-1-3. If it is not possible to pay part or all of an activation cost, none of the activation cost for activating that effect can be paid. 

8-3-1-4. Some activation costs provide instructions indicating that “something may be done.” In such cases, you can choose not to pay the activation cost, but then the effect can’t be activated. 

8-3-1-5. Some activation costs provide instructions that include circled numbers such as “①.” This means that you must choose the indicated number of active DON!! cards in your Cost Area and rest them. 

8-3-1-6. Some activation costs provide instructions such as “DON!! -X.” This means that you must choose X DON!! cards in your Leader Area, Character Area, or Cost Area and return them to your DON!! deck. 

8-3-2. Some effects include text such as [DON!! xX], [Your Turn],and [Opponent’s Turn]. These are called the effect’s conditions. 

8-3-2-1. If an effect includes multiple conditions, confirm that all of the conditions are fulfilled. 

8-3-2-2. If any conditions have been added due to different effects, confirm that all such conditions have been fulfilled. 

8-3-2-3. Some conditions provide instructions in the form [DON!! xX]. This means that at least X DON!! cards must be added to this card to fulfill the condition. 

8-3-2-4. Some conditions provide instructions indicating that it must be [Your Turn]. This means that the condition is fulfilled only during your turn. 

8-3-2-5. Some conditions provide instructions indicating that it must be the [Opponent’s Turn]. This means that the condition is fulfilled only during the opponent’s turn. 

8-4. Activation and Resolution 

8-4-1. To activate an effect, perform the procedure below. 

8-4-1-1. If the activation is subject to conditions, those conditions must be fulfilled. Activation is not possible as long as the conditions are not fulfilled. 

8-4-1-2. Specify the effect to activate. If a card in your hand has the effect, reveal that card. 

8-4-1-3. If the activation has an activation cost, determine that cost and then pay it in its entirety. 

8-4-1-4. Actually activate the effect. 

8-4-1-5. Resolve the effect. 

8-4-2. If the activated effect is an Event card effect, trash that Event card, and then execute the effect indicated on the card. 

8-4-3. If the activated effect is a Leader Area, Character Area, or Stage Area card effect, execute the effect indicated on the card. 

8-4-4. If the effect includes text such as “choose X,” “up to,” or “do X,” upon resolving the effect, choose the card, player, etc. at the instructed timing. 

8-4-4-1. If the number of items to choose is specified, you must choose that many cards, players, etc. if at all possible. However, if the text includes “up to,” you can choose zero. 

8-4-4-2. If a player must choose cards in a secret area and the card information is necessary as a condition for making this choice, there is no guarantee that the cards in that secret area have that information. In this case, the player can choose not to select a card in that area even if it fulfills the conditions. 

8-4-4-3. Unless the text explicitly specifies the card, player, etc. that must be chosen, if the effect concerns a card,it targets the source of the effect, and, if the effect concerns a player, it targets the player who triggered the effect. 

8-4-4-4. When choosing a card from a deck, check the front sides of each card in the deck and choose the specified card from among them. 

8-5. Activating Cards and Effects 

8-5-1. Card activation differs from effect activation.

8-5-2. Card activation refers to playing an Event card from your hand. 

8-5-3. Effect activation refers to activating a card’s effect.

8-5-4. As an example, if a card says “after activating an Event,” that refers to card activation. 

9. Rule Processing

9-1. Fundamental Rule Processing

9-1-1. Rule processing is a general term referring to various types of automatic processing by the rules for specific events that have occurred or are occurring throughout the game. 

9-1-2. Rule processing results in the immediate resolution of events even if they occur during the execution of other actions. 

9-2. Loss Judgment Processing 

9-2-1. At the start of rule processing, if any player fulfills any of the loss conditions below, all players fulfilling those conditions lose the game. 

9-2-1-1. If either player’s Leader sustains damage while that player has zero cards in their Life Area, that player has fulfilled the conditions for losing the game. 

9-2-1-2. If either player has zero cards in their deck, that player has fulfilled the conditions for losing the game.

11. Other

11-1. Infinite Loops 

11-1-1. When carrying out some processing, there may be occasions where an action can be or must be carried out infinitely. This is called an infinite loop, and one cycle of action from the start to the end of the loop is called a loop action. If such an event occurs, follow the procedure below. 

11-1-1-1. If neither player can stop an infinite loop, the game ends in a draw. 

11-1-1-2. If only one player has the choice to stop the infinite loop during the loop action, that player declares how many times they wish to carry out the loop action.Carry out the loop action that many times and finish it at a timing when that player can choose to stop the infinite loop. The player can’t choose to restart the loop even if the game is in exactly the same state (all cards in all areas are the same) as before the loop unless they are forced to do so. 

11-1-1-3. If both players have the choice to stop the infinite loop during the loop action, the turn player first decides how many times they wish to carry out the loop action. Next, the turn player’s opponent decides how many times they wish to carry out the loop action.Carry out the loop action the fewer of these two times and finish it at a timing when that player can choose to stop the infinite loop. The players can’t choose to restart the loop even if the game is in exactly the same state (all cards in all areas are the same) as before the loop unless they are forced to do so. 

11-2. Revealing Cards

11-2-1. As an example, if a card is moved from one secret area to another under specified conditions, such as due to an instruction to “add a “Monkey D. Luffy” card from your deck to your hand,” the moved card must be revealed even if there is no explicit instruction to do so.

11-3. Viewing Secret Areas

11-3-1. Some card effects enable players to look at cards in secret areas. Unless otherwise specified by the cards, such card effects apply only to the card’s owner. 

11-3-2. While cards are looked at, they remain in their original areas.

11-3-3. After looking at cards, if there is nothing printed in the card text regarding actions to be taken in reference to the cards that were looked at, it is necessary to return the cards to their original areas and randomize them, such as by shuffling them.
